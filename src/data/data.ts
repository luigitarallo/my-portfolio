    `Born and raised in the province of Salerno, a few years after
            getting my high school diploma, I moved to Naples to pursue a
            university degree in <span>Biotechnology</span>. <br />
            Between studying biology and enjoying a pizza "a portafoglio", I
            continued to nurture my earliest passions: computers and technology
            in all its forms. I developed a deep interest in the
            <span> Open Source </span>
            philosophy, using
            <span> Linux-based operating systems</span> and following the
            evolution of new hardware and software technologies. In my spare
            time, I provided <span>IT support</span> to acquaintances, helping
            them troubleshoot technical issues and improve their setups.`,
    `Thanks to my extensive knowledge of the tech world, in
            <span> 2018</span> I was noticed and hired by a
            <span> digital marketing</span> company specializing in the
            promotion and sale of <span>tech products</span>. This experience
            allowed me to achieve important professional and personal
            milestones, and it drove me to further explore the world of IT, not
            just by selling technology but by actively contributing to its
            development.`,
    `So, in <span>2023</span>, I decided to return to my hometown and
            pursue my passion with determination, enrolling in an intensive
            <span> bootcamp </span>to become a<span> Web Developer </span>.
            During the course, I deepened my knowledge of both
            <span> Front-End and Back-End development</span>, thanks to a
            structured program and guidance from industry professionals. In
            fact, the end of the bootcamp was only the beginning of a continuous
            journey of study, learning, and constant practice. I participated in
            a selective course focused on<span> Microsoft technologies </span>
            such as<span> C# </span>and
            <span> .NET</span>, and every day I dedicate myself to solidifying
            my knowledge, learning new technologies, and staying up-to-date with
            the latest trends in the field.`,
    `At the same time, I have collaborated with startups to develop web
            apps and continue to work on personal projects, applying and
            refining the skills I’ve acquired. My motto is:
            <span>"A day without learning something new is a day wasted"</span>.`,
    `In my free time, I recharge by<span> diving into books </span>of
            various genres, engaging in <span>DIY projects</span>, and playing
            <span> chess </span>and<span> video games </span>. I love traveling
            and spending quality time with<span> friends</span>, as well as
            trekking in nature, which helps me recharge and find new
            inspiration.`,
