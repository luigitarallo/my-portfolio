          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Born and raised in the province of Salerno, a few years after
            getting my high school diploma, I moved to Naples to pursue a
            university degree in <span>Biotechnology</span>. Between studying
            biology and enjoying a pizza "a portafoglio," I continued to nurture
            my earliest passions: computers and technology in all its forms. I
            developed a deep interest in the <span>Open Source</span>{" "}
            philosophy, using
            <span> Linux-based operating systems</span> and following the
            evolution of new hardware and software technologies. In my spare
            time, I provided <span>IT support</span> to acquaintances, helping
            them troubleshoot technical issues and improve their setups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to my extensive knowledge of the tech world, in
            <span>2018</span> I was noticed and hired by a
            <span>digital marketing</span> company specializing in the promotion
            and sale of <span>tech products</span>. This experience allowed me
            to achieve important professional and personal milestones, and it
            drove me to further explore the world of IT, not just by selling
            technology but by actively contributing to its development.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in 2023, I decided to return to my hometown and pursue my
            passion with determination, enrolling in an intensive bootcamp to
            become a Full Stack Web Developer. During the course, I deepened my
            knowledge of both Front-End and Back-End development, thanks to a
            structured program and guidance from industry professionals. In
            fact, the end of the bootcamp was only the beginning of a continuous
            journey of study, learning, and constant practice. I participated in
            a selective course focused on Microsoft technologies such as C# and
            .NET, and every day I dedicate myself to solidifying my knowledge,
            learning new technologies, and staying up-to-date with the latest
            trends in the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, I have collaborated with startups to develop web
            apps and continue to work on personal projects, applying and
            refining the skills Iâ€™ve acquired. My motto is: "A day without
            learning something new is a day wasted".
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I recharge by diving into books of various genres,
            engaging in DIY projects, and playing chess and video games. I love
            traveling and spending quality time with friends, as well as
            trekking in nature, which helps me recharge and find new
            inspiration.
